# NOTE for LEETCODE Algorithm problems

In Sunday each week, I spent time to solve each topic of problems

## This repository focuses only on problems that require real attention

+ Excludes trivial or easy-to-solve problems.
+ Filters out problems that are not important.
+ Avoids unnecessary additions or distracting information.

+ Problem 560: About how to use Prefix Sum and Hash Map.
+ Problem 17: About backtracking and using push_back() and pop_back() with string.
+ Problem 88: See again the solution of the another people.

## Some unfinished problems

+ Problem 1769: Need to add prefix sum solution.
+ Problem 3427: Just unfinished.
