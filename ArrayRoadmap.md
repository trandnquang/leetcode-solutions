# 📌 Roadmap: 12 Essential Array Problems (base from ChatGPT)

## 🌱 Beginner (Basic operations & scanning)

+ Maximum Subarray (LeetCode 53) → Kadane’s algorithm (we covered today) ✅

+ Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (26) → two pointers, overwrite array in-place ✅

+ Remove Element (27) → similar to #2 but with a given value ✅

+ Move Zeroes (283) → two pointers, stable shifting ✅

+ Plus One (66) → carry handling in arrays ✅

+ Merge Sorted Array (88) → in-place merging from the back ✅

## 🌿 Intermediate (slightly tricky logic, but no hash maps)

+ Rotate Array (189) → reverse method or extra array ⚠️ Need to review the second solution ⚠️

+ Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (121) → track min, compute profit on the fly ✅

+ Squares of a Sorted Array (977) → two-pointer from ends (because negatives) ✅ (Need to review)

+ Sort Colors (75) → Dutch National Flag problem, three pointers ⚠️ Need to review the second solution ⚠️

+ Product of Array Except Self (238) → prefix & suffix products (no division)

## 🌳 Challenge (build confidence before moving to harder DS)

+ Container With Most Water (11) → two-pointer shrinking window

+ Trapping Rain Water (42) → left-right max arrays OR two-pointer method

(If you want to go further later: Spiral Matrix (54), Set Matrix Zeroes (73), Game of Life (289) — matrix manipulation practice.)

## 🔑 Why this order works

+ 1–6: Get comfortable with array traversal, overwrite, shifting, and carry logic.

+ 7–9: Learn in-place rotations, min/max tracking, and two-pointer techniques.

+ 10–11: Step up to classic interview-style array tricks.

+ 12–13: Real “hard array” problems that combine scanning + logic.
